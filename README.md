# A Desktop Application for Controlling Blixt Circuit Breaker(s)

## Introduction
This project provides a desktop application for controlling [Blixt Circuit Breaker(s)](https://blixt.tech/).
The current generation of the circuit breaker, **Blixt Zero**, uses the [Constrained Application Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252) (CoAP) for controlling the devices remotely. 

**NOTE: This application is a work in progress. Therefore, features/functionalities are subjected for changes without prior notice.**
